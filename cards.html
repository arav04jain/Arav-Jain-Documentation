                            Freedom of speech and expression has always been considered a basic and indivisible right for a democratic society. It is crucial to the rule of law and the independence of citizens. Knowing this, Article 19(1)(a) in the Indian Constitution recognises freedom of speech and expression as a fundamental right. It states that every individual in India, regardless of their background has the right to express their opinions freely, whether it be in the form of spoken words, writing, painting, acting and/or more.<br><br>
                            It has been understood that for the functioning of a democracy, individuals must have the right to voice their thoughts. This allows the citizens of India to participate in discussions, decision-making as well as debates concerning our country. By doing so, populations can influence public policies and hold the government accountable.<br><br>
                            The history of this article has been a long one, from debates starting on its provisions by the Constituent Assembly of India to several amendments being made even recently. The Drafting committee, headed by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar played a big role in shaping the provisions of this article and over the years the Supreme Court of India has significantly helped in expanding the reach of this right. Certain amendments have been made over the years to clarify and strengthen this fundamental right in an attempt to minimize ‘loopholes’. Some of those are the inclusion of the article to protect the independence of assembly and setting models to protect this right.<br><br>
                            Although people are entitled to their opinions, it is advisable that they also consider the values of respect and tolerance. Some forms of expression like provocation of violence, hate speech and/or defamation are not protected under this right as they can cause damage to public harmony. If the government deems certain speech or expression to impair public order, question morality, defame or put the security of the state at risk, said expression can be restricted. However, there is much debate on how much the government should be allowed to restrict since it is stated they can also use these exceptions to their advantage.<br><br>
                            Article 19 remains a vital part of the Constitution, recognizing its importance in our democracy. In this evolving socio-political scene of India, the article continues to attract much debate and different interpretations.

                            Freedom of speech and expression has always been considered a basic and indivisible right for a democratic society. It is crucial to the rule of law and the independence of citizens. Knowing this, Article 19(1)(a) in the Indian Constitution recognises freedom of speech and expression as a fundamental right. It states that every individual in India, regardless of their background has the right to express their opinions freely, whether it be in the form of spoken words, writing, painting, acting and/or more.<br><br>
                            It has been understood that for the functioning of a democracy, individuals must have the right to voice their thoughts. This allows the citizens of India to participate in discussions, decision-making as well as debates concerning our country. By doing so, populations can influence public policies and hold the government accountable.<br><br>
                            The history of this article has been a long one, from debates starting on its provisions by the Constituent Assembly of India to several amendments being made even recently. The Drafting committee, headed by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar played a big role in shaping the provisions of this article and over the years the Supreme Court of India has significantly helped in expanding the reach of this right. Certain amendments have been made over the years to clarify and strengthen this fundamental right in an attempt to minimize ‘loopholes’. Some of those are the inclusion of the article to protect the independence of assembly and setting models to protect this right.<br><br>
                            Although people are entitled to their opinions, it is advisable that they also consider the values of respect and tolerance. Some forms of expression like provocation of violence, hate speech and/or defamation are not protected under this right as they can cause damage to public harmony. If the government deems certain speech or expression to impair public order, question morality, defame or put the security of the state at risk, said expression can be restricted. However, there is much debate on how much the government should be allowed to restrict since it is stated they can also use these exceptions to their advantage.<br><br>
                            Article 19 remains a vital part of the Constitution, recognizing its importance in our democracy. In this evolving socio-political scene of India, the article continues to attract much debate and different interpretations.
